  # Create comments table

  1. New Tables
    - `comments`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `post_id` (uuid, foreign key to posts)
      - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to profiles)
      - `content` (text)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on comments table
    - Add policies for authenticated users to view and create comments
