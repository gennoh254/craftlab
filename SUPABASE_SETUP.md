4. **Enable** "Allow new users to sign up"

### Row Level Security (RLS)
The migration automatically sets up RLS policies:
- Users can only access their own data

## üìÅ Storage Setup

### Create Storage Buckets
1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard

### Set Bucket Policies
For each bucket:
1. Click the bucket name
2. Go to **Policies**
3. Add these policies:

**Profile Pictures Bucket:**
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Allow public read access to profile pictures
CREATE POLICY "Public read access to profile pictures" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures');
```

**Certificates Bucket:**
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own certificates
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own certificates" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'certificates' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

-- Allow users to read their own certificates
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own certificates" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'certificates' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

## üéØ Admin Dashboard Access

### View Users
1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
2. See all registered users

   - `profiles` - User profile data
   - `certificates` - User certificates
   - `opportunities` - Available opportunities
   - `applications` - User applications

### SQL Editor
1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run custom queries
3. Export data as needed

### Example Admin Queries

**Get all users with profile completion:**
```sql
SELECT 
  p.name,
  p.email,
  p.user_type,
  p.completion_score,
  p.created_at
FROM profiles p
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

**Get certificate statistics:**
```sql
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM certificates
GROUP BY status;
```

**Get application statistics:**
```sql
SELECT 
  o.company,
  o.title,
  COUNT(a.id) as applications
FROM opportunities o
LEFT JOIN applications a ON o.id = a.opportunity_id
GROUP BY o.id, o.company, o.title
ORDER BY applications DESC;
```
